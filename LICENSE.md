## Properietary

Consider this project license as a proprietary as I have not decided on any opensource yet.

I am pretty sure in the future the open license will be set up. I just don't care about licensing until this thing
works a least a little it.

The fact that the source code is available is currently a lucky coincidence. :shrug:
